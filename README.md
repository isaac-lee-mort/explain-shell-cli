# explain-shell-cli
A poorly written wrapper for explainshell.com

Currently only with with Redhat operating systems, but will be very easy to adjust to use with other Operating systems.

The script explain.sh can be copied to /usr/bin/explain and +x permission. Can then call the file as follows:
[isaac@still-alive ~]# explain --dump 'rsync -avh --progress'
